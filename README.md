# Kinematics-Estimation-Puma
The Main goal of this project was to estimate the position and orientation of a 1Feetx1Feet Square placed in a room to which the robot(Puma) was to aim a laser beam at.All the three rotaion angles of the joints are noted down which are feed to the solver in the Matlab Code.The Challenge was to determine the Oretiation and the postion of the square with minimum number of co-orinates the laser was pointed at and the postures of the robot.I took 3 Co-odinates, one of which is taken in two postures of the robot.
